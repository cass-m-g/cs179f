// my_stubs.H

// These are the prototypes of the functions defined in my_stubs.cc,
// plus the definition of the struct my_DIR and the macro MY_DIR,
// which is needed to compile our modified version of bbfs.c.

// Note tha all of our functions have int as their return values, with
// the exceptions of my_opendir which returns a pointer to a MY_DIR,
// and readdir, which returns an pointer to a dirent.  the functions
// my_lstat() and my_fstat(), return struct stat by pointer reference.
// similarly my_utime fills in a struct time buffer that is passed by
// pointer reference.
